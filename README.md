# OMEN

# How to run:
To preform the first time setup and play the game run one of the provided scripts(addressed below). The script will automatically setup all the necesary software the first time you start the script.
After the install the script will start the javascript server, needed to access all game files and open your default web browser with the game ready.
Then enjoy our first ever game project :)

### For Windows users:
Run the "startOmen.ps1" script and type Y (as yes) when the terminal prompts for your access

### For Linux users:
Run the "startOmen.sh" script. The script should automatically check for and install the software via your default package manager

### For Mac users:
The script isn't provided yet, this document will be updated soon to include a script for MacOS users as well
